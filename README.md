# ubuntu-openbox-setup
Install scripts and settings for current openbox on Thinkpad X220

[Ubuntu Minimal Install 17.10](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/artful/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso)

Place the 'openbox' folder in '~/.configs'

The install script will create the autostart file based on the programs being installed, it will also download the .conkyrc file into the home directory to get started.

This script is optimized for the Thinkpad X220, including hardware optimization.
